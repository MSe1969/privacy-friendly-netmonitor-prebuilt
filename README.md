# Privacy Friendly Net Monitor #

This app monitors active network sockets and provides information on the scanned connections and apps. The invoking app is identified and listed with it's name, package and icon. The Connection's local and remote socket information (ip/port) is displayed along with a resolved hostname information and protocol evaluation based on well-known ports. Known un-/encrypted protocols are automatically marked. Additional features can be activated in the settings tab. This includes a panel for detailed technical information on connections, a logging functionality to keep scan results, and a remote analysis of TLS-Servers via SSL-Labs API.

This app is optimized regarding the user’s privacy. It doesn’t use any tracking mechanisms, neither it displays any advertisement. It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the SECUSO research group at Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.
